Assumptions:
- Passenger priority decreases/increases on the weather. If it is raining it should decrease, however, if they have not been picked up yet, their priority should go back to normal.
- Passengers cannot have their priority changed besides coins while they are in the taxi (ie, rain should not have an effect when passenger is already in the taxi).
- If a passenger walks past a trip end flag whilst following the driver, the passenger should complete the trip and render last trip completed at the bottom left.
- Taxis are said to do 100 damage within the specification sheet, so technically the taxi hitting the car or enemy car should de render it,        however the smoke and fire images are still displayed when a car is destroyed.
- Made boundaries so taxi cannot just go off the road.
